Amazon Price Tracker

This project is a price tracking script built with Python. Its main purpose is to check the price of a product on Amazon and send an email alert when the price drops below a certain amount.

Features

Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: Pulls the current price of the product from Amazon.

Price Comparison: Checks if the price is lower than the target value.

Email Notifications: Sends an email alert with the product name, current price, and product link if the condition is met.

Environment Variables: Uses .env file for storing sensitive information like email and password securely.

Goal

The goal of this project was to practice web scraping, environment variable management, and automation with Python. It gave me experience with libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and smtplib, as well as working with .env files for security. This script can be reused and adjusted to track prices of different products.
